## 🆘 Getting Help in Linux

Linux provides **three main ways** to get help about commands. These exist because not all commands are created the same way — some are **built into the shell**, and others are **external programs**.

| Command        | What It Does                           | Best For...                                 |
|----------------|-----------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| `man <command>`| Opens a full manual page                | Learning all options of a command like `ls`  |
| `<command> --help` | Shows a quick summary              | Quickly checking available flags             |
| `help <command>` | Shows help for bash built-in commands | Commands like `cd`, `exit`, `history`        |

### ✅ Examples:

- Full manual:
  ```bash
  man ls

## 🔍 Searching Files in Linux

| Command                      | Recursively Searches? | Handles Filenames with Spaces? | Best Use Case                          |
|-----------------------------|------------------------|----------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| `ls | grep ".txt"`          | ❌ No                  | ❌ No                            | Quick filter in current directory      |
| `find . -name "*.txt"`      | ✅ Yes                 | ✅ Yes                           | Searching deeply through directories   |

🔸 **Key Difference:**  
`ls | grep` is limited to the current folder, while `find` is far more powerful and robust for large or nested searches.
