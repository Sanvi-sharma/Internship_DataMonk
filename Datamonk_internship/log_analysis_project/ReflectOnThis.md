## 🆘 Getting Help in Linux

Linux provides **three main ways** to get help about commands. These exist because not all commands are created the same way — some are **built into the shell**, and others are **external programs**.

| Command        | What It Does                           | Best For...                                 |
|----------------|-----------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| `man <command>`| Opens a full manual page                | Learning all options of a command like `ls`  |
| `<command> --help` | Shows a quick summary              | Quickly checking available flags             |
| `help <command>` | Shows help for bash built-in commands | Commands like `cd`, `exit`, `history`        |

### ✅ Examples:

- Full manual:
  ```bash

## 🔍 Searching Files in Linux

Difference Between `ls | grep ".txt"` and `find . -name "*.txt"`

Searching for files in Linux can be done in multiple ways, but understanding **how** and **when** to use each method is important.

### 🆚 Key Differences

| Feature                        | `ls | grep ".txt"`                              | `find . -name "*.txt"`                          |
|-------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| **Searches subdirectories?**  | ❌ No — only current directory                  | ✅ Yes — searches recursively                   |
| **Handles special filenames?**| ❌ No — breaks with spaces or symbols           | ✅ Yes — handles spaces and special characters  |
| **Speed on large directories**| ✅ Faster, but limited in scope                 | ❌ Slower, but thorough                         |
| **Flexibility**               | ❌ Low — just filters visible list              | ✅ High — can search by time, size, etc.        |
