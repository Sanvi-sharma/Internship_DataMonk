## 🆘 Getting Help in Linux

Linux offers three main ways to get help because different types of commands require different tools:

| Command        | Purpose                                 | When to Use                               |
|----------------|------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| `man <command>`| Full manual pages                        | For external programs like `ls`, `find`    |
| `<command> --help` | Quick syntax help                    | For GNU utilities with built-in help flags |
| `help <command>` | Shell built-in help                    | For bash built-ins like `cd`, `alias`      |

🔸 **Why multiple options?**  
Because not all commands are the same type—some are built into the shell, others are standalone binaries.

🔸 **Only `help` works for:**  
Commands like `cd`, `history`, `exit` — which are part of the shell itself.

## 🔍 Searching Files in Linux

| Command                      | Recursively Searches? | Handles Filenames with Spaces? | Best Use Case                          |
|-----------------------------|------------------------|----------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| `ls | grep ".txt"`          | ❌ No                  | ❌ No                            | Quick filter in current directory      |
| `find . -name "*.txt"`      | ✅ Yes                 | ✅ Yes                           | Searching deeply through directories   |

🔸 **Key Difference:**  
`ls | grep` is limited to the current folder, while `find` is far more powerful and robust for large or nested searches.
Both commands aim to find .txt files, but they work differently:

ls | grep ".txt":
    Filters file names in the current directory only.
    Simple and fast, but limited.
    May not handle special characters or nested folders well.

find . -name "*.txt":
    Searches recursively through the current directory and all subfolders.
    More powerful and flexible for deep searches.
    Handles special characters and file paths better.

✔️ Use ls | grep when working in a known folder.
🔍 Use find when you need to explore subdirectories or unknown paths.

## 📜 Piping to grep (Searching Command History)

To search your command history using `grep`:

```bash
history | grep <keyword>
history | grep "ls"
