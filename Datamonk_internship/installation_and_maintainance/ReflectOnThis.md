# APT vs Snap in Ubuntu

## Question  
The lesson introduces both **APT** and **Snap**.  
Why might a developer choose to install an application using Snap even if itâ€™s available in the official APT repositories?  
What are the potential trade-offs (e.g., application startup time, disk space usage, automatic updates)?  

---

## Answer  

### ðŸ”¹ Why Choose Snap Over APT?  
A developer may prefer **Snap** over **APT** because:  
- **Latest Versions** â†’ Snaps are updated automatically and often earlier than APT packages.  
- **Cross-Distribution Support** â†’ Snaps work across multiple Linux distributions, not just Ubuntu/Debian.  
- **Security Isolation** â†’ Each Snap runs in a sandbox, providing better security.  
- **Bundled Dependencies** â†’ Snap packages include all required libraries, ensuring consistent behavior everywhere.

### Trade-Offs Between APT and Snap  

| Aspect              | **APT (Deb Packages)**                          | **Snap (Containerized Packages)**                  |
|---------------------|-------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| **Startup Time**    | Faster (runs natively).                         | Slower (due to sandboxing overhead).              |
| **Disk Space**      | Efficient (shared libraries).                   | Larger (includes all dependencies).               |
| **Updates**         | Manual/semi-automatic via `apt upgrade`.        | Automatic, always up to date.                     |
| **Compatibility**   | Works mainly on Debian/Ubuntu systems.          | Works across multiple Linux distros.              |
| **Security**        | Relies on system permissions.                   | Stronger isolation via sandboxing.                |

- **Use APT** â†’ When you want speed, lighter disk usage, and deeper system integration.  
- **Use Snap** â†’ When you prefer automatic updates, cross-distro compatibility, and stronger security.

# ripgrep (rg) vs grep

## Question  
For searching through a large software projectâ€™s source code, why is **rg** often a significantly better choice than the standard **grep** command?  

---

## Answer  

### ðŸ”¹ Why `rg` is Better than `grep` in Large Projects  

- **Speed** â†’ `rg` (ripgrep) is written in Rust and uses advanced search algorithms that are much faster than `grep`. It can search through gigabytes of code in seconds.  
- **Ignores Unwanted Files** â†’ By default, `rg` respects `.gitignore`, `.ignore`, and `.rgignore` files, skipping files like binaries, logs, and build artifacts.  
- **Smart Defaults** â†’ Unlike `grep`, `rg` automatically searches recursively through directories without needing extra flags.  
- **Developer-Friendly Output** â†’ `rg` highlights matches by default and shows line numbers, making results easier to read.  
- **File Type Filters** â†’ With `rg`, you can search only certain file types (e.g., `--type py` for Python files).

### Comparison Table  

| Feature                | **grep**                            | **rg (ripgrep)**                       |
|-------------------------|--------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| **Performance**         | Slower on large codebases.           | Extremely fast, optimized for big repos. |
| **Recursion**           | Needs `-r` flag.                     | Recursive by default.                   |
| **Ignores Files**       | Doesnâ€™t respect `.gitignore`.        | Respects `.gitignore`, `.ignore`.       |
| **Output**              | Plain text, no colors by default.    | Colored, highlighted, line numbers.     |
| **File Type Filtering** | Requires complex regex.              | Simple flags like `--type`.             |

# curl vs wget

## Question  
Describe a specific task where **curl** is the only appropriate tool for the job, and another task where **wgetâ€™s** features make it the superior choice.  
What core design difference between the two utilities leads to these distinct use cases?  

---

## Answer  

### ðŸ”¹ When `curl` is the Only Appropriate Tool  
- **Task:** Interacting with APIs (sending HTTP requests with custom headers, tokens, or data).  
- Example:  
```bash
# Send a POST request with JSON data to an API
curl -X POST https://api.example.com/data \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"name":"Sanvi","age":20}'
```
âž¡ curl is designed for data transfer and supports complex HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.), making it the go-to for API testing and web service interaction.
### When wget is the Superior Choice

Task: Downloading an entire website or large files with resume support.

Example:
```bash
# Mirror a website locally (recursively download)
wget --mirror --convert-links --page-requisites --no-parent https://example.com

# Resume a large file download
wget -c https://example.com/largefile.iso
```
âž¡ wget excels at file retrieval, recursive downloading, and resuming interrupted downloads, which curl does not handle as effectively.

# Fetching GitHub Repository Names and Languages with curl & jq

You can use `curl` and `jq` to fetch your public repositories from GitHub and create a clean list of their **names** and **main programming languages**.

---

## Step 1: Fetch your public repositories

Use the GitHub API endpoint for your user:

```bash
curl -s https://api.github.com/users/<username>/repos
```
